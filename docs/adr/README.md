# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Study Tracker project.

## Documenting Decisions

We follow the Nygard template for ADRs. Each record should include:

- **Title**: A clear description of the decision.
- **Date**: When the decision was made.
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded.
- **Context**: The problem we are trying to solve and any constraints.
- **Decision**: The chosen solution.
- **Consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts of the decision.
