# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-02-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to track the architectural decisions made during the development of the Study Tracker project to ensure transparency, provide historical context, and facilitate onboard of new developers.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADR) as described by Michael Nygard. We will store these records in the `docs/adr` directory of the project.

## Consequences

- Architectural decisions will be documented and searchable.
- Developers will have a clear understanding of "why" certain technologies or patterns were chosen.
- A small overhead is added to the decision-making process to document the choice.
